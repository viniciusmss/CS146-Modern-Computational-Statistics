# CS146: Modern Computational Statistics
Selected assignments and coding exercises from the class CS146: Modern Computational Statistics. The notebooks may contain terms or concepts that targeted the description of the assignment or Minerva's grading structure. Such sections should not prevent the reader from understanding the code structure.

There are two assignments contained in this repo. In [Berlin Groceries Cost Modeling](https://github.com/viniciusmss/CS146-Modern-Computational-Statistics/blob/master/Berlin%20Groceries%20Cost%20Modeling.ipynb), I modeled the price variation of groceries in Berlin according to brand, neighborhood, and product using PyStan under a Bayesian statistical framework. In [Modeling and forecasting atmospheric CO2](https://github.com/viniciusmss/CS146-Modern-Computational-Statistics/blob/master/Modeling%20and%20forecasting%20atmospheric%20CO2.ipynb), I use a similar approach to the task of modeling historic CO2 atmospheric levels. For the latter project, consult also the accompanying [report](https://github.com/viniciusmss/CS146-Modern-Computational-Statistics/blob/master/Modeling%20and%20forecasting%20atmospheric%20CO2.pdf).
